Phase 3: TODO List Project (JavaScript DOM Practice)

ðŸ“Œ Description:
This is a simple TODO List web app built using HTML, CSS (with Bootstrap), and JavaScript. It allows users to:
- Add tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks
- Add tasks using Enter key

ðŸŽ¯ Concepts Practiced:
- DOM Selection: querySelector, getElementById
- Event Handling: click, keydown, change
- Element Creation: createElement, innerHTML
- Appending/Removing Elements: appendChild, remove()
- Input Validation: trim() to avoid empty entries
- Dynamic UI updates without reloading

ðŸ§  How It Works:
1. User types a task and clicks "Add" or presses Enter.
2. A new list item is created and added to the task list.
3. The task includes:
   - A checkbox to mark it completed (with strikethrough effect)
   - A delete button to remove the task
4. If input is empty, task is not added.

âœ… Outcome:
Successfully implemented dynamic task handling using JavaScript and understood DOM manipulation deeply.
